#What Is pymine2#
pymine2 is a simple, lightweight Minecraft server written in Python. The goal is to provide a lightweight alternative to the otherwise bulky official Minecraft Server. Our goal is to ensure that it can run smoothly on low power/low end ARM hardware, such as the original iPod Touch. 

#Cross-Platform#
Since it is written in Python, it can be run on most operating systems with Python 2.7 installed, including
Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Android and iOS.

#Usage#
To start the server, cd to the server directory and run

> python start.py
